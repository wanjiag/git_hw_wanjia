### I'm a first year graduate student in [Brice Kuhl](https://kuhllab.com/)'s lab at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/).

#### I am currently working on how pattern differentation happens in the hippocampus with fMRI. I use Python and R for data collection and analysis. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking, (failing at) baking (and trying again), and hiking.

#### You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GWJ_Amber), [Github](https://github.com/wanjiag), and [Email](mailto:wanjiag@uoregon.edu).
