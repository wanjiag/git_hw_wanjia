## I'm a first year graduate student in Brice Kuhl's lab at the University of Oregon.

### I am currently working on how pattern differentation happens in the hippocampus with fMRI. I use Python and R for data collection and analysis. Outside the lab, I enjoy cooking, (failing at) baking (and trying again), and hiking.
